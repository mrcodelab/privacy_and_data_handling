<h1># Privacy and Data Handling</h1>

<h2>too long; didn't read (tldr;): </h2>

I will not store your passwords for any reason.

I will not store your personal data for any reason.




<h2>Passwords</h2>
For services requiring administrative credentials, input of your administrative password may be required:<br>
1) Enter your credentials during the serivce procedure - when prompted by Windows.<br>
<b>NOTE: Your presence is required to complete system cleanup and optimization. I will not take your password</b><br>
<br>
<i>It is recommended that you change your administrative password at the completion of any remote support session.</i>
<br><br>

<h2>Data Handling</h2>
For services requiring:<br>
1) Data backups<br>
2) Data migrations<br>

The user will provide a suitable external storage device or cloud backup service for the procedure. If necessary, I will provide a suitability assessment free of charge before services are performed. 
I will not open or inspect file contents unless requested in writing. I will make no records of user data as I do not posess infrastructure sufficient to secure such data.






<h1>Disclaimers</h1>

This information applies to Windows 10 PC's only.<br>
I am not responsible for any hardware failures. <br>

Data preservation is the <b>User's</b> responsibility. I am not responsible for lost files as a result of cleanup procedures.<br>

Cleaning and optimizing your Windows PC is not a guarantee of performance improvement. Software and system changes can only improve within the limits of the hardware. This procedure cannot turn a 10 year old laptop into a state-of-art performance machine.
I use industry best practices to make perforance improvements and extend the life of your PC. 




<h1>Understanding the Procedure</h1>
Using a tool called TeamViewer I will connect to your computer to perform cleanup functions. I use Windows Powershell to perform certain tasks and temporarily install specialty software to perform registry cleanup <i>if included in the package</i>.<br>
Input of the administrative password may be required for multiple steps. The user must input the password at each prompt - requiring user presence throughout the procedure.
<br>
Generally, these cleanup procedures do not pose any risk to personal files. If I find that storage limitations must be addressed, I will work with the user to identify files which can be removed or recommend storage expansion options.<br>
<br>
Upon completion, I will remove the registry cleaning software. The user is <b>strongly encouraged</b> to change administrative passwords.
